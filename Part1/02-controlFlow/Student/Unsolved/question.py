#TODO Finish the following coding task
#You are given a variable temperature that represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius by using python function input().
#Write a Python program prints the state of water at that temperature.
#If the temperature is below 0째C, it should print "The water is in solid state (ice)."
#If the temperature is between 0째C (inclusive) and 100째C (exclusive), it should print "The water is in liquid state."
#If the temperature is 100째C or above, it should print "The water is in gaseous state (steam)."
