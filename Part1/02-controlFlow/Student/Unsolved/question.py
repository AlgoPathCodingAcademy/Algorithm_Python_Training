#Sequence Structure
#1. Create a Python program that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting message.
#2. Create a Python program that takes two numbers from the user, adds them together, and prints the result.
#3. Create a Python program that calculates how old the user will be in a certain number of years.
#4. Create a simple unit converter that asks the user for a measurement in kilometers and converts it to miles.
#Note 1 mile = 0.621371 kilometers

#Selection Structure
#TODO Finish the following coding task
#You are given a variable temperature that represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius by using python function input().
#Write a Python program prints the state of water at that temperature.
#If the temperature is below 0째C, it should print "The water is in solid state (ice)."
#If the temperature is between 0째C (inclusive) and 100째C (exclusive), it should print "The water is in liquid state."
#If the temperature is 100째C or above, it should print "The water is in gaseous state (steam)."

#Iteration Structure
#TODO Print the even number up to 15 using for loop


#TODO Print the even number up to 15 using while loop


#TODO Modify the following for loop code to while loop by
#checking they are printing the identical content.

    for j in range(i):
        print(j+1, end=' ')
