#Sequence Structure
#1. Create a Python program that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting message.
#2. Create a Python program that takes two numbers from the user, adds them together, and prints the result.
#3. Create a Python program that calculates how old the user will be in a certain number of years.
#4. Create a simple unit converter that asks the user for a measurement in kilometers and converts it to miles.
#Note 1 mile = 0.621371 kilometers

#Selection Structure
#TODO Finish the following coding task
#You are given a variable temperature that represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius by using python function input().
#Write a Python program prints the state of water at that temperature.
#If the temperature is below 0째C, it should print "The water is in solid state (ice)."
#If the temperature is between 0째C (inclusive) and 100째C (exclusive), it should print "The water is in liquid state."
#If the temperature is 100째C or above, it should print "The water is in gaseous state (steam)."

#Develop a program that determines the age group of a person based on their age.
#Use the following categories: Child (0-12), Teen (13-19), Adult (20-64), Senior (65+).
#Note:12, 19, 64, and 65 are included in their respective age groups.

#Write a Python program that functions as a simple calculator. The program should prompt the user to
#input two numeric values and choose one of four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
#The program should then display the result of the operation.

#Iteration Structure
#TODO Print the even number up to 15 using for loop


#TODO Print the even number up to 15 using while loop


#TODO Modify the following for loop code to while loop by
#checking they are printing the identical content.
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(i):
        print(j+1, end=' ')
    print()

print("Your solution ...")
